This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML involving unexpected behavior when concatenating different data types within the innerHTML property. The bug.html file shows the incorrect implementation where a string is concatenated with a number within the innerHTML assignment. This leads to the number being treated as a string and appended to the paragraph, resulting in unexpected output. The bugSolution.html demonstrates the corrected implementation where data types are handled correctly.  This is a subtle bug that can be easily missed if not careful about data type handling when using innerHTML.
